# Learning_react
This is the repository consisting of working with React.
and my self React notes.

- React is a library it consists of :
react-dom - for web workings
react-native - for mobile workings


 * METHOD 1
# npx create-react-app
-basic method of creating React app.
[ It's a slower method however]

 npm 

npm: node package manager
npx: node package executor
create-react-app :utility

# package.json
-entry point of react project
-has name of project, version, dependencies & scripts(run the project, start, build, test) & browserlist

- to run the project - start script
npm start <--or-->
# npm run start

[note: react has seo problem ]

- npm run build
-js, this folder is the actually served in production




* METHOD 2
Vite- react bundler
through this we make react app

-no node modules initially ?
# npm i
or npm install

# npm run dev


index.html
-Main Single page of application 

index.js or main.js
- entry pt of react


* package .json
// vitereact app bhitra react scripts xaina unlike create-react app

in ViteReact app : .jsx is used instead of .js like in create-react-app

* Best Pracitces :
- capatilized names of Components
- Few libraries force you to have .jsx in components


# React Hooks:

React controls updation of variables to be seen in UI
